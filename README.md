# Chess-AI-Site
Chess AI written in JavaScript. This not an actual AI using machine learning but just a few clever algorithms. This is a school project by the way...

### Description 
In this digitalt design udvikling (DDU) we are using the commerical EEG-device, Muse S headband. Our program consists of a user-friendly chess game. The purpose is to monitor the corresponding brain frequencies related to focus so that we will be able to determine the optimal brain stimulus from playing the developed chess game with the main goal of mTBI (mild traumatic brain injury) rehabilitation. In addition, there will be a description of the program's requirements, these will benefit the continuous measurement of the project's progression using GitHub's PMS.

### The use of EEG 
The reason behind the use of the EEG-device is to estimate the optimal amount of time spent using the chess program with the current aim of rehabilitation. It is well known that when the Theta frequency's amplituide drops so does the focus of the individual. This we have demonstrated in our collection of more than 5.000 data points on two individuals. The first individual is our real-world persona of our target audience (P2) and the other, our supervisor (P1). 

In the first recording: 246,843 Rows (8392.662 total data points) Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamme wavelenghts were monitored on P1
In the first recording: 335,640 Rows (11 411,76 total data points) on Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamme wavelenghts were monitored on P2
