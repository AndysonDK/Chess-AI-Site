Chess AI written in JavaScript. This not an actual AI using machine learning but just a few clever algorithms. This is a school project by the way...

### Description 
In this digitalt design udvikling (DDU) we are using the commerical EEG-device, Muse S headband. Our program consists of a user-friendly chess game. The purpose is to monitor the corresponding brain frequencies related to focus so that we will be able to determine the optimal brain stimulus from playing the developed chess game with the main goal of mTBI (mild traumatic brain injury) rehabilitation. In addition, there will be a description of the program's requirements, these will benefit the continuous measurement of the project's progression using GitHub's PMS.
